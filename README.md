What-Eats

What-eats is a practice project built to fulfill a need, This need is the question "what do i eat today?".
This app solves that by generating a randomized list of items into a menu based on items entered by the user.
The idea behind this is that everyone has foods they eat commonly. So you would add the foods you eat regularly
to our database which would then prepare a menu for you to prepare for the week thus answering "what do i eat today?".
